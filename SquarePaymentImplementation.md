# Square Payment Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Square payment integration for the SimStudio booking system. The integration uses Square's hosted Checkout solution to securely process payments without collecting sensitive payment information directly in our application.

## Implemented Features

1. **Square Checkout Integration**
   - Implemented Square Checkout API for secure, hosted payment processing
   - Created payment link generation endpoint
   - Added payment verification and success handling
   - Configured redirect URLs for seamless user experience

2. **Database Updates**
   - Added `square_customer_id` field to the users table in database.types.ts
   - Created migration script to handle database updates
   - Added temporary users table for guest checkout flow

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Created checkout link generation API endpoint
   - Implemented payment verification endpoint
   - Added metadata handling for tracking orders and users

4. **Authentication Integration**
   - Maintained Supabase authentication system
   - Implemented hybrid approach for user account management
   - Added functionality to create or update Square customer records when users sign in

5. **Guest Checkout Flow**
   - Implemented pre-checkout minimal information collection
   - Created temporary user records for guest users
   - Added post-payment account creation process
   - Added clear messaging about account creation during the checkout process

## Key Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `lib/square.ts` - Square client initialization
- `pages/api/create-checkout.ts` - Checkout link generation endpoint
- `pages/api/verify-payment.ts` - Payment verification endpoint
- `pages/checkout/success.tsx` - Success page for handling Square redirects
- `lib/migrations/add-temp-users-table.js` - Migration script for temporary users table

### Modified Files
- `components/CheckoutForm.tsx` - Updated to use Square Checkout instead of direct payment form
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to include Square customer management
- `lib/database.types.ts` - Added square_customer_id field to users table
- `package.json` - Added Square SDK and migration script
- `.env.example` - Added Square environment variables
- `PaymentAuthIntegrationPlan.md` - Updated implementation status

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in `.env.local`:

```
# Square Configuration
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-square-access-token
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your-square-location-id
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'production'
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Your application URL for redirects
MERCHANT_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@simstudio.com  # Optional: Support email shown on checkout page
```

## Testing

The implementation uses Square's hosted checkout pages in all environments:

- The CheckoutForm component redirects users to Square's hosted checkout page
- Square handles all payment information collection and processing
- After payment, users are redirected back to the application
- A detailed testing guide is available in `SquareTestingGuide.md` with test scenarios

For testing in the sandbox environment, you can use the following test card numbers on Square's checkout page:
- Visa: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- Mastercard: 5105 1051 0510 5100
- American Express: 3782 822463 10005
- Discover: 6011 1111 1111 1117

Use any future expiration date, any 3-digit CVV (4 digits for Amex), and any 5-digit postal code.

## User Authentication Flow

The implementation uses a hybrid approach for user authentication:

1. **For Logged-in Users:**
   - User logs in through existing Supabase auth
   - User selects services/packages and proceeds to checkout
   - Application creates a Square Checkout link with the user's ID in metadata
   - User is redirected to Square Checkout
   - After payment, Square redirects back to the success page
   - Success page verifies payment and adds credits to the user's account

2. **For Guest Users:**
   - User selects services/packages and proceeds to checkout
   - Application collects minimal information (name, email) before checkout
   - Application creates a temporary user record
   - Application creates a Square Checkout link with a reference ID in metadata
   - User is redirected to Square Checkout
   - After payment, Square redirects back to the success page
   - Success page verifies payment, completes account creation in Supabase, and adds credits

## Next Steps

1. **Get Square Location ID**
   - Log in to Square Developer Dashboard
   - Navigate to Sandbox Test Account > Locations
   - Copy the Location ID and update `.env.local`

2. **Test Payment Flow**
   - Start the development server with `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to a page that uses the CheckoutForm component
   - Test the payment process in the sandbox environment

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Update environment variables for production
   - Set `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production`
   - Replace sandbox credentials with production credentials
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your production URL

## Benefits of Square Checkout

1. **Reduced PCI Compliance Scope**: Square handles all the payment data collection, significantly reducing PCI compliance requirements
2. **Enhanced Security**: Payment information never touches your servers
3. **Simplified Implementation**: No need to manage card input fields or tokenization
4. **Mobile-Optimized Experience**: Square's checkout pages are designed for all devices
5. **Built-in Features**: Support for various payment methods, shipping fees, custom fields, etc.

## Notes

- The Square Checkout API creates a hosted payment page that handles all payment information collection
- User information is securely passed between the application and Square using metadata
- Error handling is in place to gracefully handle payment failures and verification issues
- The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing Supabase authentication system
