## Implementation Approach

The recommended implementation approach is to develop both the cancellation approval system and the coaching credit refund system together in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Database & Backend Changes
- Update database schema for both systems
- Modify the bookings API to handle cancellation requests
- Implement the CoachCredit system for coaching cancellations

### Phase 2: Admin Interface
- Create the cancellation approval interface
- Add options for handling different types of refunds
- Implement the refund processing logic

### Phase 3: User Interface
- Update the cancellation flow in the user account page
- Add messaging about the approval process
- Display Simulator Hours and CoachCredit from cancelled bookings

### Phase 4: Email Notifications
- Implement all notification templates
- Set up the notification triggers

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize the implementation plan
2. Prioritize development tasks
3. Begin implementation with database schema changes
4. Develop and test each component incrementally
5. Deploy the complete system

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Automated Approvals**
   - Automatically approve cancellations that meet certain criteria
   - Reduce admin workload for standard cases

2. **Cancellation Analytics**
   - Track cancellation reasons and patterns
   - Identify opportunities for business improvement

3. **Partial Cancellations**
