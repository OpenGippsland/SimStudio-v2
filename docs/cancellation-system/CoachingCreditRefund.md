I understand that direct monetary refunds are too complex to implement at this stage. Here's an alternative approach that avoids refunding money while still addressing the issue of canceled coaching sessions:

## Store Coaching Credits as CoachCredit

Instead of refunding money, you could convert canceled coaching fees into CoachCredit that can be used for future bookings:

1. __CoachCredit System__:

   - When a user cancels a booking with coaching, convert the coaching fee to CoachCredit
   - This credit is automatically applied to future bookings (either simulator time or coaching)
   - No actual money is refunded, just store credit

2. __Implementation Approach__:

   - Add a `coach_credit` field to the `credits` table (or create a separate table)
   - When a booking with coaching is canceled, add the coaching fee amount to the user's CoachCredit
   - During checkout, automatically apply available CoachCredit to reduce the payment amount

3. __UI Updates__:

   - Show available CoachCredit in the user's profile
   - Display applied credit amount during checkout
   - Display clear messaging about the cancellation policy

## Enhanced Cancellation Approval System

To improve the cancellation process and integrate it with the coaching credit refund system, we'll implement an admin approval workflow:

1. __Cancellation Request Workflow__:

   - Users must provide a reason when requesting a cancellation
   - All cancellations (including those within 24 hours of the booking) will be submitted for admin review
   - Cancellations are not automatically processed; they require admin approval
   - Users will be notified that late cancellations (within 24 hours) may not receive credit refunds

2. __Admin Approval Interface__:

   - Admins can review all cancellation requests in a dedicated admin panel section
   - For each request, admins can see booking details, cancellation reason, and timing
   - Admins have options to:
     * Approve with full refund (simulator hours + coaching credit)
     * Approve with partial refund (simulator hours only)
     * Approve with no refund
     * Reject the cancellation request

3. __Database Changes__:

   - Add fields to track cancellation requests:
     * `cancellation_reason` - User's explanation for cancellation
     * `cancellation_requested_at` - Timestamp of request
     * `cancellation_status` - Status tracking ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')
     * `is_late_cancellation` - Flag for cancellations within 24 hours

4. __Email Notifications__:

   - Users receive confirmation when their cancellation request is submitted
   - Admins/coaches are notified of new cancellation requests
   - Users receive notification when their request is approved or rejected
   - Notifications include relevant details about any credits refunded

5. __Integration with Credit System__:

   - When a cancellation with coaching is approved, the system will:
     * Return Simulator Hours to the user's account
     * Convert coaching fees to CoachCredit as per the CoachCredit System
   - The admin interface provides flexibility to handle special cases

## Non-Refundable Coaching with Clear Policy

Alternatively, you could maintain the current non-refundable approach but with improved transparency:

1. __Clear Cancellation Policy__:

   - Update the UI to clearly indicate that coaching fees are non-refundable
   - Add this information at multiple points in the booking flow
   - Include a checkbox for users to acknowledge this policy

2. __Cancellation Window__:

   - Implement a cancellation window (e.g., 24-48 hours before the session)
   - Allow free cancellation of coaching sessions if done within this window
   - After the window closes, the coaching fee becomes non-refundable

3. __Admin Override__:

   - Add an admin function to manually issue credits or refunds in exceptional cases
   - This keeps the system simple while allowing for flexibility in special circumstances

## Coach-Specific Credit System

A third option would be to implement coach-specific credits:

1. __Coach-Specific Credit Tracking__:

   - Track credits for each coach separately in the database
   - When a user cancels a session with Coach A, they get Coach A credits
   - These credits can only be used for future sessions with Coach A

2. __Implementation__:

   - Create a `coach_credits` table with `user_id`, `coach_id`, and `hours` fields
   - When canceling, add the hours to the appropriate coach-user combination
   - When booking, check for and use available coach-specific credits first

This approach maintains the variable pricing between coaches while still providing a credit system for cancellations.

## Recommendation

Of these options, I recommend implementing the __CoachCredit System__ with the __Enhanced Cancellation Approval System__ as it:

- Avoids direct money refunds
- Provides admin control over the cancellation process
- Handles late cancellations appropriately
- Gives flexibility for special circumstances
- Maintains a good user experience
- Keeps money within your system as CoachCredit
- Leverages existing admin interfaces for credit management
- Simplifies the checkout process with automatic credit application
