## ~~2. About~~
~~**Page title:** Learn about driver coaching and education with Sim Studio~~

~~**H1:** Let's talk about Sim Studio~~

~~*I wrote all of these to be subsections of the About page, but now think these should all be their own child pages (because theres way more content that I was thinking), in which case instead of being H2 headings they will just be H1s on page and use that for the page title also, eg. 'How to book | Sim Studio'. H3s become H2s etc. They dont need to be in the menu, just make the About parent page show tiles / links for each of these.*~~

### ~~2.5. Our story~~
~~**H2:** Our story - Why Sim Studio?~~

~~Sim Studio is a specialised training facility based around a pro-level driving simulators, offering both motorsport coaching and road-based driver education.~~ 

#### ~~There is a gap (H3)~~
~~On the road, parents, driving schools, and individuals need a safe, structured environment for learners and advanced road safety education, with limited options available outside of real-world driving.~~

~~In Motorsport, simulators have become an essential tool for race drivers - but there are no dedicated simulator-based coaching studios in Australia offering structured, high-level coaching - until now.~~

#### ~~Road or Race? (H3)~~
~~Why not both?!~~

~~Road focus: Designed for learner drivers, advanced road safety training, and individuals looking to build confidence in a controlled, risk-free setting~~

~~Race focus: Focused on motorsport coaching for drivers looking to enhance their skills, train for competitions, and maximise their performance in a structured environment~~

~~By utilizing professional-grade simulators, Sim Studio provide a cost-effective, accessible, and highly efficient alternative to traditional driver training.~~

#### ~~Where We Are Now (H3)~~
~~Simulators are fast becoming recognised as essential for driver development - traditional driving schools focus on passing the driving test, but few offer risk-free simulator-based training to build real-world skills before getting behind the wheel.~~

~~At Sim Studio, we believe there is a unique opportunity to create a specialized driver training business that meets the demands of both race drivers and everyday road users.~~

#### ~~Where We Want to Be (H3)~~
~~Our goal is to establish Sim Studio as the go-to destination for structured, simulator-based driver training.~~

~~- Bridging motorsport and road safety: We cater to both aspiring race drivers and every day road users, making us the most versatile simulator training facility in the country~~

~~- Open access for professionals and businesses: Our facility is available for race teams, coaches, and driving schools to integrate simulator training into their own programs~~

#### ~~Benefits of Simulator-Based Training (H3)~~
